# ripenv

**ripenv** is a comprehensive, military-grade solution for managing encrypted environment files and API secrets across development teams. Built with a security-first approach, ripenv addresses the critical challenge of secret management in modern software development workflows.

## üö® The Critical Need for Secret Management

The software industry faces an unprecedented crisis in secret management:

-   **18,000+ exposed API secrets** discovered across 1 million domains in the web, including Discord webhooks and critical service tokens ([The API Secret Sprawl Report](https://escape.tech/the-api-secret-sprawl-2024))
-   **3,325 secrets compromised** in the Ghost Action supply chain attack (September 8, 2025), affecting PyPI, npm, and DockerHub tokens through malicious GitHub workflows([Git Guardian](https://blog.gitguardian.com/ghostaction-campaign-3-325-secrets-stolen/))
-   **12.8 million secrets accidentally leaked** on public GitHub repositories in 2023 alone([Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/13-million-secrets-public-github/))

ripenv provides a robust, cryptographically secure solution to prevent these devastating security breaches while maintaining developer productivity.

-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini for natural language command processing

## üîí Security Model & Threat Analysis

### **Cryptographic Guarantees**

-   **Confidentiality**: XSalsa20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption
-   **Integrity**: Built-in authentication tags prevent tampering
-   **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys are rotated per encryption operation
-   **Key Derivation**: Argon2id with tuned parameters resistant to GPU attacks

### **Trust Boundaries**

-   **Client-side key generation**: Private keys never transmitted
-   **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Server only stores encrypted data and public keys
-   **Compartmentalized access**: Project-based isolation with granular permissions
-   **Audit trail**: Comprehensive logging of all cryptographic operations

### **Threat Mitigation**

-   ‚úÖ **Insider threats**: Encrypted at rest with individual key wrapping
-   ‚úÖ **Supply chain attacks**: Cryptographic verification of all operations
-   ‚úÖ **Data breaches**: Zero plaintext exposure on server infrastructure
-   ‚úÖ **Credential theft**: Automatic rotation with configurable intervals
-   ‚úÖ **Social engineering**: Multi-factor authentication via email verification
